HI THERE!!!!!!! this is my first ever godot project. as per the flavortown rules, i hereby declare that i DID technically use gpt to understand how the _process system works in Godot.
im sorry. documentation is hard to read :(
anyways. i will try my best to keep updating this project, and maybe even recreate it in C++ one day. 
but for now...
